Hey there! It's [Ellie](https://el-lie.ju.mp) from [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/), the global hacker community! This repository includes everything you need to get started on a super cool React app that you'll be able to learn from to ~ elevate your web apps! 

This repo was made for the Hack with React workshop at Global Hack Week: INIT, a week long event to kickoff the Major League Hacking 2023 Season! Want more resources from ellie? Check out the [mlh-ellie](https://mlh-ellie.uwu.ai/) stream resources site!

- do you have `node` or `yarn` installed?  

### Download node.js

## Let's set up React! 
This repo already includes the react template imported. I also made a few comments to explain what some of the files do. If you happen to be working on your own repo, you can use the command below in your terminal to get the React environment setup. 

```
yarn create react-app my-app
```

## Let's see it live! 
Now that we have our base code ready to go, lets look at our current site! 

```
cd my-app
```
```
yarn && yarn start
```

the development server will start! You'll view it on http://localhost:3000/
